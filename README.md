## Source of my Hompage and Blog

This page was build with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) using [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) 
and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), with the  [Foundation 5](http://foundation.zurb.com/) Framework. 

Starting point was the [Middleman-Foundation5-Basic](https://github.com/RalphAtHamburg/middleman-foundation5-basic) 
project template, which I offen use for quick startup. The readme file from this project gives some instructions to
get the project running under middleman.

## Covered Middleman features
